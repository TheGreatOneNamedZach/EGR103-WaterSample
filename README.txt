EGR 103-005-005
Created by the team:
Double O' Five
Spring of 2024

Welcome to our humble abode! This script directory is object-oriented.
  This means the code is easy to use, but hard to navigate. As such, this
  file "README.txt" will give a summary of every file in this directory.
  First, lets start with the highest parent files:
    * The "initialize" folder contains the files to be executed.
    * The "other" folder contains test and miscellaneous scripts.
    * The "README" text file acts as a guide to the projects code.
    * The "LICENSE" text file contains the projects license (MPL 2.0).

  Next, the "initialize" folder:
    * The "waterSampler" script is the main script ran for the project.
    * The "waterSamplerGUI" app contains sub-system code. DON'T RUN THIS!

  Finally, the "other" folder:
    * The "Wildzach" script contains Zachary's EGR 101 final project.
        It has working code for processing and manipulating images and is
        used as the framework for the vision system.
    * The "AppForArduinoLML" app contains a working example of how to use
        the pieces and parts of a MATLAB app.
    * The "GUI_ProofOfConcept" folder contains Zachary's proof of concept
        for the GUI sub-system.
        * The "ExampleHydroponicData" spreadsheet is given test data.
        * The "GUI_POC" app is the proof of concept app.
    * The "ImageProcessingExample" script shows a working example of how to
        use bounding boxes and image recognition.
    * The "Cyan_Pink_Stickers" image is for the "ImageProcessingExample" script.
    * The "ColdHot" image is for the "AppForArduinoLML" app.
    * The "WaterDrop" image is for the "waterSamplerGUI" app.
    * The "secrets" text file contains any secrets used. (local file)

If you want to run this project, make sure you add the file
  "EGR103_WaterSample" to the working directory in MATLAB! Here is how:
    1. Switch to the "HOME" tab.
    2. Click "Set Path".
    3. Click "Add with Subfolders".
    4. Select the "EGR103_WaterSample" file and click "Select folder".
    5. Click "Save".
  You can tell it worked if the folder icon for "EGR103_WaterSample" is
  no longer grayed out.


Congrats on reading this far! Here is a bonus duck.
